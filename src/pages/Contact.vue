The Wyvern Protocol is permissionless – anyone can contribute – and the protocol's governance is decentralized — run by <a target="_blank" href="https://dao.projectwyvern.com">the Wyvern DAO</a> — so if you want to build on the protocol, you don't need to ask us first (and we can't stop you) — just <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/projectwyvern">submit a pull request on Github</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://dao.projectwyvern.com/proposals/create">create a proposal through the DAO web UI</a>.
<br /><br />
That said, we'd love to hear from you anyways! To contact the current development team, please email <a href="mailto:team@projectwyvern.com">team@projectwyvern.com</a>. For real-time support, jump on <a target="_blank" href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#projectwyvern:matrix.org">our Matrix chat (via Riot)</a>.

This software is published pseudonymously as we'd prefer to attract interest solely based on the quality of the technology, and you shouldn't need to trust us in order to use a trustless protocol! We are not trying to evade the law. If you have a valid reason to require an identity, such as legal compliance, email us and ask. Determining whether or not to buy WYV tokens is not a valid reason.
